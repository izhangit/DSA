# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python programming languages. It's a collection of commonly used data structures and algorithms, along with explanations.

## What is DSA?
- **Data Structures:**  
  Data structures refer to specialized formats for organizing and storing data to facilitate efficient access and modification. They help in managing and organizing data in memory, enabling operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.

- **Algorithms:**  
  Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or processes used to solve problems or perform specific tasks. These procedures are designed to perform well, with     considerations for time and space complexity. Efficient algorithms are crucial for optimizing the use of resources and ensuring quick and accurate results. Algorithms are applied to manipulate data within various data structures, sort and search, perform mathematical computations, and more.
  
  In software development, understanding and implementing efficient data structures and algorithms are essential for building high-performance applications and solving complex computational problems. Mastery of DSA allows developers to optimize code, improve application performance, and tackle a wide range of computational challenges effectively.


### List of data structures: 

- **Linked List**: A linear collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
- **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) collection that supports adding and removing elements from the top.
- **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) collection that supports adding at the rear and removing from the front.
